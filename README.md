# Human-Following-Robot-MP-I-Project
A compact Arduino-based Human-Following Robot that uses ultrasonic and IR sensors to detect, follow, and maintain a safe distance from a person. The robot automatically adjusts direction using dual IR sensors and controls motor movement through an L298N motor driver.
